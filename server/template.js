  'The Beery Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual Motor Integration (VMI) assesses skills which are the foundational components of writing. It consists of three subtests which measure skills relating to the integration of the visual and motor systems (eye and hand coordination) and isolated motor coordination and visual perception skills. These tasks also rely upon cognitive skills, as well as visual analysis skills. The test presents the examinee with drawings of 30 geometric forms, arranged in a developmental sequence, from less to more complex. The examinee simply copies these forms in a Test Booklet. Two subtests, the VMI Visual Perception Test and the VMI Motor Coordination Test can each also administer. They are generally given if VMI results indicate a need for further testing.';
